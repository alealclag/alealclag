# üëã Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm AlejandroüòÄ

![Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=alealclag&show_icons=true)

I'm a Fullstack Web Developer looking for opportunities to grow. Here at GitHub you'll find some projects I've worked on / I'm currently working on.

Despite having used many different technologies for my projects, my most recent works involve the **MERN** stack.

## üë®‚Äçüíª What I work with (mainly)

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-%23563D7C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)

For me, the MERN stack can deliver what I need for my projects in a simple but effective way:

- React allows to structure the front-end in a modular way with components and hooks, which sometimes can seem a bit confusing, but shows its usefulness when there has to be changed made to the code.

- Node works pretty well for building different types of apps in an easy way, which, combined with Express, makes it super-easy to create the back-end for our web apps.

- With MongoDB we are able to create and manage a functional database with almost 0 knowledge given its simplicity. This doesn't only makes MongoDB an easy to use database, but also a versatile one, so that almost every small to medium project can make use of it.

Along with the stack, Bootstrap is also used to deliver responsive and modern designs that give freshness to our apps.

At last but not least, with Git we are able to control and track the different changes made to our projects, whether it be alone or with teammates

## üëì Things I know how to use

![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)

![jQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/jquery-%230769AD.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=jquery&logoColor=white)

Apart from the main technologies mentioned in the last part, there are some others that I also use from time to time, so working with them isn't a problem a t all

## üìÉ Some other things I've used

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
![.Net](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-5C2D91?style=for-the-badge&logo=.net&logoColor=white)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)

These are some other technologies I've used in the past and now I have a bit rusty, but wouldn't be too hard to cath up with!
